# Linear Regression from Scratch

Welcome to the Linear Regression from Scratch project! This repository contains Python code to implement a simple linear regression model without using any external libraries, providing a hands-on learning experience in machine learning fundamentals.

## Overview

Linear regression is a fundamental technique in machine learning for predicting continuous target variables based on input features. This project demonstrates how to build a linear regression model from scratch using Python and NumPy.

## Features

- **LinearRegression Class**: Implements core functionalities including:
  - Fit: Calculating the slope and intercept of the regression line using the least squares method.
  - Predict: Making predictions on new data points using learned parameters.
  - Evaluation Metrics: Calculating R-squared and RMSE to assess model performance.
